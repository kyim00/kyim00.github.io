<b>What was accomplished in the project as compared to what was planned?</b>
<br>
What I accomplished turned out to be a bit different from what I had initially planned since I had a hard time executing my original plan. I had initially wanted to have the user be able to access the cart even if they had not logged in and was planning to accomplish that by using sessions to save the user's cart information, but I had a hard time trying to figure that out and getting the information to save when the user left the page. I instead ended up saving the user's cart information to their account. Other than the mandated login before viewing the cart, the rest of the design that I had planned turned out similar. So after adding items to the cart, when the user was ready to make their purchase, they will click the submit button on the bottom and since they are already logged in, it should send them their invoice via their email.

<b>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</b>
<br>
Some issues that I had was that for some of my pages, my interface design was a bit off and not working properly. I think I was able to address all of the issues regarding that at the end though because I was having some problems where my footer would extend into my body and some of the texts were not being properly centered or the layout of the site would change. 

<b>What was your biggest project risk and how was it managed?</b>
<br>
I think the biggest risk that I took would be saving my product information on javascript instead of through JSON. In hindsight, it would have probably been easier and I would have had less code to write and therefore less areas for mistakes if I had saved the product information through JSON. With javascript, I had to create a product's page for each of the different product array and sometimes I would have to change things in the product's page so therefore if I changed one thing in one product's page, I would also have to modify that change in the other 3 product's pages as well. This lead to some inconsistencies between the pages and possible opportunities of error. Though I was able to manage it by holding off until I finalized the first product page to create the other product pages so I would not need to modify the other pages as much.

<b>What is your assessment of the overall quality of the system?</b>
<br>
I think it turned out pretty well. It is functional and has a clean and simple interface design that is easy to use and navigate. The site was able to meet the requirements and served its purpose. I think that the coding for it could have been simplified, but at the end it was able to meet its goals.

<b>What is needed before this system can be placed into operation?</b>
<br>
If this site were to be used for a real operation, I would need to make changes to my code to be simpler and to be easily read and understood by others. Some of my naming conventions could be confusing if another person were to use it, so I would need to simplify the code for real usage. My site also does not process actual payments so that's another implementation that I would need to include for actual usage.

<b>Describe what you are most proud of about this project:</b>
<br>
I am most proud that I was able to create a functional site and just all of the progress that I have made so far. I started off with very limited knowledge on coding and through this project, it challenged me to think in a new way and I have to use a different thinking process than I do with my other classes. Although I am still far from being an expert on this, I am able to at least understand different codes and am familiar with the basics. I think the most amazing feature of this project was the server and all the different processes that were occurring. I actually built this project off of the the very basic ecommerce website that I had to do in BUS 311 so I used the same concept and design of selling jewelry, but in that class, our things on the site did not have to actually work and function so it's very satisying to see the growth from the two sites and amazing to see that the actions from one page can actually transfer to other pages, like log in information and purchasing products.

<b>Describe what you are least happy with this project:</b>
<br>
The part that I am least happy about is the design. I think the design is okay for now, but it could be better and more creative. Therefore the design is a little bit simple since I chose to go for a minimalist and clean look since my main priority for this project was making sure that it functioned properly so I exerted more energy on the functionality of the site.

<b>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown.
