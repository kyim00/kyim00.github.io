My name is Kimberly Yim and I am currently a third year undergraduate at the University of Hawaii majoring in Accounting and Management Information Systems.
When I was initially entering college, I was planning to pursue a career in the healthcare field, but after experiencing some volunteering at a surgical center and clinic, I found that it wasn't the right fit for me. I decided to switch my major to accounting because I have always been oddly drawn to this field growing up and loved the structure involved with it. After speaking with other fellow accounting students, they recommended me to consider double majoring with MIS as it would be a good supplement to my accounting degree. Besides the small introduction of coding that was taught in ICS 101 and BUS 311, my experience with the world of MIS has been very limited. Although the assignments for those classes were laborious, I found the process of developing websites from the ground up to be a rewarding experience. Therefore, I wanted to challenge myself and knew that it would be a beneficial technical skill in the long run, especially in this technology dominated world. I am looking forward to this class and learning more about information systems.
